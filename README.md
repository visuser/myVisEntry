Plasma in a tokamak is confined within a magnetic field.
The visualization shows a poloidal cross section (R,Z coordinates in a 2-D plane) of the magnetic field, referred to as psi.
The field changes over time as shown in the animation.
The data, stored in a netCDF file variable, is in the form f(x,y,t).
Each time step is extracted and plotted using Python Matplotlib.  A short pause is inserted between plots so that each frame of the animation is displayed.
